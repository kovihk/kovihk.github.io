    <h1>KOVI Refund and Exchange Policy</h1>

        <li>You must provide proof of purchase, such as the original receipt or order number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Refundable Items</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For hygiene reasons, we do not offer refunds or exchanges on private items such as underwear or other intimate clothing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Refund Process</h2>

        <li>Once your return is approved, you will be responsible for shipping the item back to us. Return shipping costs are covered by the customer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Refund Methods</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Customers are responsible for covering return shipping fees.</li>
        <li>We recommend using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</li>
